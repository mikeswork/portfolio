It was interesting to use the DOM IntersectionObserver object to keep track of where the user is in the overall page and then to make visual/route updates accordingly. Extracting this logic out into util/useScrolledTo.js, and importing it as a state hook into the components that should respond to scrolling, felt like an elegant approach."

Each user automatically gets a basic, default account that keeps track of their points. They earn points by visiting certain areas, completing games, or achieving minimum scores.
